# Interactive Dots

Interactive Dots is a Python program that allows you to create dots on the screen by clicking and observe their interactions based on gravitational-like forces. You can click and hold the mouse button to create a dot, and the longer you hold, the bigger the dot becomes. The dots will then move and interact with each other, simulating an attractive force similar to gravity.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuillBla/Attractive-Dots.git
cd interactive-dots
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

- Left-click and hold to create a dot. The longer you hold, the bigger the dot will become.
- The dots will interact with each other based on gravitational-like forces.
- Close the window or press `Ctrl + C` to exit the program.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the simulation to suit your preferences:

- Adjust the display size: Modify the `width` and `height` variables in the `main.py` file to change the size of the display window.
- Customize dot colors: Modify the `BACKGROUND_COLOR` and `DOT_COLOR` variables in the `main.py` file to change the colors of the background and dots, respectively.
